# Exe: Code Analytics
Exe Code Analytics was been created to provide a extensible code analyse to Exe: Classwork.

I will work to make this lib more efective and extract more information!

## Warning
Current Exe Code Analytics features are enough for Exe: Classwork, so I will return to Exe: Classwork development. 

In the future I want to improve more features and support for this library.
